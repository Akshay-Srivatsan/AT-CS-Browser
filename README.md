# AT CS Browser
A basic browser written in Java 8, which supports tabbed browsing, branching history, bookmarks, session cookies, a debugger, and printing.
This browser was originally written as a project for my Advanced Topics in Computer Science class. As such, the documentation is in [README.pdf](README.pdf) instead of here.

## TODO:
* Move documentation here.
* Add fully packaged binaries.
